# hello-world-github
The most common first exercise to learn programming.

Hi,

I am Hassaan Zuberi and I am enroute to become a software developer. I loved the share amount of possibilities you get to implement different ideas if you know how to program. I have done a good amount of programming in the past but never thought to share it with the world. My goal is not only to showcase my skills on GitHub but also to contribute those skills to the open source community. 

After nine months of research, studying and learning; I have finally decided to commit to software engineering as a career path. I believe, I have all the support from my friends and family to see it through. 

Considering my short-term goal, I want to get proficient in Javascript and the Javascript Stack (MongoDB - Express - REACT - Node). I should be able to make and manage full-blown dynamic web applications and kick-start my career in Full Stack Web Development. 

As far as the long-term goal is concerned, it will be a continued learning process; getting better in what I do, learning new languages and frameworks, working on unique and exciting projects, learning from the best people, getting a mentor, work more efficiently and productively within a dev team or may be launch my own startup.
